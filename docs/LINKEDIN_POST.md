- **RLS Implementation**: Row Level Security policies ensuring zero cross-user data access
- **Context Preservation**: Persistent chat memory with intelligent session restoration

**2. AI Integration Architecture**
- **Specialized Agent System**: 4 distinct AI agents (CV Optimizer, Email Assistant, Interview Coach, Job Analyst)
- **Context-Aware Prompts**: Each agent has tailored system prompts for specific use cases
- **Token Management**: Intelligent context window management with truncation strategies
- **Multi-Modal Input**: Text-based CV upload with PDF extraction capabilities

**3. Data Pipeline Innovation**
- **N8N Integration**: Automated job scraping ‚Üí AI analysis ‚Üí Rating system ‚Üí Database storage
- **Text Processing Pipeline**: LaTeX cleaning, encoding normalization, PDF artifact removal
- **Real-time Processing**: Live CV analysis with AI-powered skills extraction

### **üõ†Ô∏è Technical Solutions Implemented**

**Authentication & Security**
```typescript
// Multi-client Supabase strategy
- Authenticated client for user data
- Anonymous client for public job browsing
- Service role client for admin operations
- JWT token validation with middleware
```

**Session Management**
```typescript
// Strict isolation implementation
- User-specific session lookup
- Job-specific conversation contexts
- Agent-specific memory isolation
- Cross-agent data prevention
```

**AI Context Building**
```typescript
// Intelligent prompt construction
- Job requirements analysis
- CV skills matching

- **Result**: Each agent maintains perfect conversation memory per job

**2. CV Processing Innovation**
- **Challenge**: Handling various CV formats (PDF, LaTeX, DOC)
- **Solution**: Multi-stage text processing pipeline with AI analysis
- **Result**: Structured data extraction from any CV format

**3. Security Implementation**
- **Challenge**: Preventing cross-user data access
- **Solution**: Comprehensive RLS policies with middleware validation
- **Result**: Zero data leakage between users

**4. AI Context Management**
- **Challenge**: Managing conversation context within token limits
- **Solution**: Intelligent truncation and context window optimization
- **Result**: Efficient AI responses with full conversation history

### **üîß Technology Stack Deep Dive**

**Frontend Architecture**
- Next.js 15 with App Router for optimal performance
- React 19 with concurrent features
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui design system
- Zustand for state management

**Backend & Database**
- Supabase (PostgreSQL) with built-in auth
- Prisma ORM for type-safe database operations
- Row Level Security for data isolation
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates

**AI & Integration**
- OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for intelligent responses
- Custom prompt engineering for specialized agents
- Context-aware conversation management
- Multi-modal input processing

**Security & Validation**
- Zod schemas for comprehensive validation
- JWT token management
- Rate limiting and security headers
- Input sanitization and XSS prevention

### **üìä Database Schema Design**

**Core Tables with RLS**
```sql
- users: Profile and authentication
- jobs: Job opportunities and tracking
- chat_sessions: Conversation sessions
- messages: Individual chat messages
- cvs: Resume management
- Linkedin_JobFound: Public job data
```

**Key Relationships**
- User ‚Üí Jobs (one-to-many)
- Job ‚Üí Chat Sessions (one-to-many)
- Session ‚Üí Messages (one-to-many)
- User ‚Üí CVs (one-to-many)

### **üöÄ N8N Pipeline Integration**

**Data Flow Architecture**
1. **Job Scraping**: Automated collection from multiple sources
2. **Data Reformating**: Standardization and cleaning
3. **AI Analysis**: N8N AI agent for job attribute identification
4. **Rating System**: 10-point scale based on job description metrics
5. **Database Storage**: Structured data insertion into Supabase

### **üí° Problem-Solving Philosophy**

**"If you can automate your own life, then you are capable to automate for others"**

This project demonstrates deep technical thinking by:

1. **Identifying Core Problems**: Session management, data isolation, context preservation
2. **Designing Scalable Solutions**: Multi-layer architecture with clear separation
3. **Implementing Robust Systems**: Error handling, validation, security
4. **Optimizing for Performance**: Efficient queries, token management, caching
5. **Ensuring User Experience**: Intuitive interfaces with powerful backend capabilities

**This project showcases the ability to think deeply about complex problems and implement sophisticated solutions using modern technologies. It's not just about using libraries A, B, C, D - it's about understanding the underlying problems and architecting solutions that are scalable, secure, and user-centric.**

**The key insight: True automation comes from understanding the human workflow and building systems that enhance rather than replace human capabilities.**
